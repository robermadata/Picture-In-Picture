# Picture-In-Picture
**Project Title: Picture in Picture**

**Description:**
This project enables users to initiate Picture-in-Picture mode using their browser. It allows them to select a media stream, usually their screen or a window, and display it in a floating window while still being able to interact with other content on the screen. The application provides a simple interface with a "START" button to initiate the Picture-in-Picture mode.

**Setup Instructions:**
1. Download or clone the project repository from [GitHub Link].
2. Ensure you have a compatible browser that supports Picture-in-Picture mode.
3. Open the project directory in your preferred code editor.
4. Customize the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files as needed for your application.
5. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view and interact with the application.

**File Structure:**
- **index.html**: Contains the HTML structure of the application, including the video element and button for initiating Picture-in-Picture mode.
- **style.css**: Contains the styling rules for the application interface.
- **script.js**: Contains the JavaScript code responsible for handling user interactions and initiating Picture-in-Picture mode.

**Usage:**
1. Open the `index.html` file in a compatible browser.
2. Click on the "START" button to begin.
3. Follow the browser prompts to select the desired media stream (e.g., screen or window).
